[git.io/bash-tools](https://git.io/bash-tools)

450+ DevOps Shell Scripts and Advanced Bash environment.

Fast, Advanced Systems Engineering, Automation, APIs, shorter CLIs, etc.

Heavily used in many [GitHub repos](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user%3Aharisekhon+type%3Arepository&type=Repositories), dozens of [DockerHub builds](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon) ([Dockerfiles](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Dockerfiles)) and 400+ [CI builds](https://bitbucket.org/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools/src/master/STATUS.md).

#### Summary:

- Scripts for many popular DevOps technologies, see [Inventory](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools/blob/master/README.md#inventory) below for more details
- Advanced configs for common tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), [PostgreSQL psql](https://www.postgresql.org/) etc...
- CI configs for most major Continuous Integration products (see [CI builds](https://bitbucket.org/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools/src/master/STATUS.md) page)
- CI scripts for a drop-in framework of standard checks to run in all [CI builds](https://bitbucket.org/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools/src/master/STATUS.md), CI detection, accounting for installation differences across CI environments, root vs user, virtualenvs etc.
- API scripts auto-handling authentication, tokens and other details to quickly query popular APIs with a few keystrokes just supplying the `/path/endpoint`
- Advanced Bash environment - `.bashrc` + `.bash.d/*.sh` - aliases, functions, colouring, dynamic Git & shell behaviour enhancements, automatic pathing for installations and major languages like Python, Perl, Ruby, NodeJS, Golang across Linux distributions and Mac. See [.bash.d/README.md](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools/blob/master/.bash.d/README.md)
- Installs the best systems packages - [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), [GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) kubectl & kustomize, [jx](https://jenkins-x.io/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) etc... extensive package lists for servers and desktops for all major Linux distributions package managers and Mac
- Utility Libraries used by many hundreds of scripts and [builds](https://bitbucket.org/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools/src/master/STATUS.md) across [repos](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user%3Aharisekhon+type%3Arepository&type=Repositories):
  - `.bash.d/` - interactive library
  - `lib/` - scripting and CI library
- [SQL Scripts](https://github.com/HariSekhon/SQL-scripts) - 80+ scripts for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) + [CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)

### Quick Setup

To bootstrap, install packages and link in to your shell profile to inherit all configs, do:

```
curl -L git.io/bash-bootstrap | sh
```

- Adds sourcing to `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile` to automatically inherit all `.bash.d/*.sh` environment enhancements for all technologies (see [Inventory Overview](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools#Inventory-Overview) below)
- Symlinks `.*` config dotfiles to `$HOME` for [git](https://git-scm.com/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/), top, [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/), [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) `.psqlrc` etc. (only when they don't already exist so there is no conflict with your own configs)
- Installs OS package dependencies for all scripts (detects the OS and installs the right RPMs, Debs, Apk or Mac HomeBrew packages)
- Installs Python packages including [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

To only install package dependencies to run scripts, simply `cd` to the git clone directory and run `make`:

```
git clone https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools bash-tools
cd bash-tools
make
```

`make install` sets your shell profile to source this repo. See [Individual Setup Parts](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools#Individual-Setup-Parts) below for more install/uninstall options.

### Inventory
- `.*` - dot conf files for lots of common software eg. advanced `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`, massive `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.screenrc`, `.tmux.conf` etc.
  - `.vimrc` - contains many awesome [vim](https://www.vim.org/) tweaks, plus hotkeys for linting lots of different file types in place, including Python, Perl, Bash / Shell, Dockerfiles, JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, INI / Properties files, LDAP LDIF etc without leaving the editor!
  - `.screenrc` - fancy [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) configuration including advanced colour bar, large history, hotkey reloading, auto-blanking etc.
  - `.tmux.conf` - fancy [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) configuration include advanced colour bar and plugins, settings, hotkey reloading etc.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/):
    - `.gitconfig` - advanced Git configuration
    - `.gitignore` - extensive Git ignore of trivial files you shouldn't commit
    - enhanced Git diffs
    - protections against committing AWS secret keys or merge conflict unresolved files
- `.bashrc` - shell tuning and sourcing of `.bash.d/*.sh`
- `.bash.d/*.sh` - thousands of lines of advanced bashrc code, aliases, functions and environment variables for:
  - [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) & [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
  - SCM - [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), [Svn](https://subversion.apache.org)
  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  - [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)
  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  - automatic GPG and SSH agent handling for handling encrypted private keys without re-entering passwords, and lazy evaluation to only prompt key load the first time SSH is called
  - and lots more - see [.bash.d/README](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools/blob/master/.bash.d/README.md) for a more detailed list
  - run `make bash` to link `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile` and the `.*` dot config files to your `$HOME` directory to auto-inherit everything
- `lib/*.sh` - Bash utility libraries full of functions for

#### Individual Setup Parts

Optional, only if you don't do the full `make install`.

Install only OS system package dependencies and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) via Python Pip (doesn't symlink anything to `$HOME`):

```
make
```

Adds sourcing to `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` and symlinks dot config files to `$HOME` (doesn't install OS system package dependencies):

```
make link
```

undo via

```
make unlink
```

Install only OS system package dependencies (doesn't include [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or Python packages):

```
make system-packages
```

make python
```

### Full Help

```
> make help

 Usage:

  Common Options:

    make help                   show this message
    make build                  installs all dependencies - OS packages and any language libraries via native tools eg. pip, cpanm, gem, go etc that are not available via OS packages
    make build-retry            retries 'make build' x 3 until success to try to mitigate temporary upstream repo failures triggering false alerts in CI systems
    make ci                     prints env, then runs 'build-retry' for more resilient CI builds with debugging
    make printenv               prints environment variables, CPU cores, OS release, $PWD, Git branch, hashref etc. Useful for CI debugging
    make system-packages        installs OS packages only (detects OS via whichever package manager is available)
    make test                   run tests
    make clean                  removes compiled / generated files, downloaded tarballs, temporary files etc.

    make submodules             initialize and update submodules to the right release (done automatically by build / system-packages)
    make init                   same as above, often useful to do in CI systems to get access to additional submodule provided targets such as 'make ci'

    make cpan                   install any modules listed in any cpan-requirements.txt files if not already installed

    make pip                    install any modules listed in any requirements.txt files if not already installed

    make python-compile         compile any python files found in the current directory and 1 level of subdirectory
    make pycompile

    make github                 open browser at github project
    make readme                 open browser at github's README
    make github-url             print github url and copy to clipboard
    make status                 open browser at Github CI Builds overview Status page for all projects

    make ls                     print list of code files in project
    make wc                     show counts of files and lines

  Repo specific options:

    make install                builds all script dependencies, installs AWS CLI, symlinks all config files to $HOME and adds sourcing of bash profile

    make link                   symlinks all config files to $HOME and adds sourcing of bash profile
    make unlink                 removes all symlinks pointing to this repo's config files and removes the sourcing lines from .bashrc and .bash_profile

    make python-desktop         installs all Python Pip packages for desktop workstation listed in setup/pip-packages-desktop.txt
    make perl-desktop           installs all Perl CPAN packages for desktop workstation listed in setup/cpan-packages-desktop.txt
    make ruby-desktop           installs all Ruby Gem packages for desktop workstation listed in setup/gem-packages-desktop.txt
    make golang-desktop         installs all Golang packages for desktop workstation listed in setup/go-packages-desktop.txt
    make nodejs-desktop         installs all NodeJS packages for desktop workstation listed in setup/npm-packages-desktop.txt

    make desktop                installs all of the above + many desktop OS packages listed in setup/

    make mac-desktop            all of the above + installs a bunch of major common workstation software packages like Ansible, Terraform, MiniKube, MiniShift, SDKman, Travis CI, CCMenu, Parquet tools etc.
    make linux-desktop

    make ls-scripts             print list of scripts in this project, ignoring code libraries in lib/ and .bash.d/

    make kubernetes             installs kubectl and kustomize to ~/bin/
    make vim                    installs Vundle and plugins
    make tmux                   installs TMUX TPM and plugin for kubernetes context
    make ccmenu                 installs and (re)configures CCMenu to watch this and all other major HariSekhon GitHub repos
    make status                 open the Github Status page of all my repos build statuses across all CI platforms

    make aws                    installs AWS CLI tools
    make azure                  installs Azure CLI
    make gcp                    installs Google Cloud SDK

    make gcp-shell              sets up GCP Cloud Shell: installs core packages and links configs
                                (maintains itself across future Cloud Shells via .customize_environment hook)
    make azure-shell            sets up Azure Cloud Shell (limited compared to gcp-shell, doesn't install OS packages since there is no sudo)

Now exiting usage help with status code 3 to explicitly prevent silent build failures from stray 'help' arguments
make: *** [help] Error 3
```

(`make help` exits with error code 3 like most of my programs to differentiate from build success to make sure a stray `help` argument doesn't cause silent build failure with exit code 0)
