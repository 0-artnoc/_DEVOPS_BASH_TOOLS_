========================

Bash utility library used by my other repos.

Currently utilized to supplement testing of the following repos:

[Pre-built Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon/) are available for those repos (which include this one as a submodule) and the ["docker available"](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/centos-github/)  icon above links to an [uber image](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon/centos-github/) which contains all my github repos pre-built.
