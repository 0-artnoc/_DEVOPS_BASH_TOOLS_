200+ Shell Scripts, Advanced Bash environment & Utility Code Library.

Used heavily by all my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/harisekhon), dozens of [DockerHub builds](https://hub.docker.com/r/harisekhon)([Dockerfiles](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Dockerfiles)) and 300+ [CI builds](https://bitbucket.org/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools/src/master/STATUS.md).

Contains:

- Scripts for fast advanced systems administration including auto-populating required switches
- Scripts for CI builds, forming a drop-in framework of standard checks
- Advanced Bash environment - `.bashrc` + `.bash.d/*.sh` - tonnes of advanced customizations, aliases and functions. See [.bash.d/README.md](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools/blob/master/.bash.d/README.md)
- Advanced configuration files for common tools like [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), installs the best sysadmin packages like those above plus [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), [GCloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and many others, adds dynamic Git and shell behaviour enhancements, colouring, functions, aliases and automatic pathing of many common installation locations for many major languages like Python, Perl, Ruby, NodeJS, Golang...
- Utility library used in many scripts here and sourced from other repos, using the 2 libraries
  - `.bash.d/` - interactive library (huge)
  - `lib/` - scripting and CI library (heavily used by hundreds of scripts and builds)

For more advanced Systems Administration scripts in other languages, see the repos listed at the bottom of the page.

These scripts can be used straight from the git clone, but see setup benefits of `make install` next.

### Quick Setup

```
make install
```

- Adds sourcing to `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile` to automatically inherit all `.bash.d/*.sh` environment enhancements for all technologies (see [Inventory Overview](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools#Inventory-Overview) below)
- Symlinks all `.*` config files to `$HOME` for [git](https://git-scm.com/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/), top, [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/), [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) etc.
- Installs OS package dependencies for all scripts (detects the OS and installs the right RPMs, Debs, Apk or Mac HomeBrew packages)
- Installs Python packages including [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

`make install` effectively does `make system-packages bash python aws`, but if you want to pick and choose from different sections, see [Individual Setup Parts](https://github.com/harisekhon/devops-bash-tools#Individual-Setup-Parts) below.

### Inventory Overview

- Scripts - [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) / [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) systems administration scripts:
  - installation scripts for various OS packages (RPM, Deb, Apk) for various Linux distros ([Redhat RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) / [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) / [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) / [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/))
  - install if absent scripts for Python, Perl, Ruby, NodeJS and Golang packages - good for minimizing the number of source code installs by first running the OS install scripts and then only building modules which aren't already detected as installed (provided by system packages), speeding up builds and reducing the likelihood of compile failures
  - install scripts for [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) and build tools like [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) for when Linux distros don't provide packaged versions or where the packaged versions are too old
  - Git branch management
  - utility scripts used from other scripts
- `.*` - dot conf files for lots of common software eg. advanced `.vimrc`, `.gitconfig`, massive `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.screenrc`, `.tmux.conf` etc.
  - `.vimrc` - contains many awesome [vim](https://www.vim.org/) tweaks, plus hotkeys for linting lots of different file types in place, including Python, Perl, Bash / Shell, Dockerfiles, JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, INI / Properties files, LDAP LDIF etc without leaving the editor!
  - `.screenrc` - fancy [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) configuration including advanced colour bar, large history, hotkey reloading, auto-blanking etc.
  - `.tmux.conf` - fancy [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) configuration include advanced colour bar and plugins, settings, hotkey reloading etc.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/):
    - `.gitconfig` - advanced Git configuration
    - `.gitignore` - extensive Git ignore of trivial files you shouldn't commit
    - enhanced Git diffs
    - protections against committing AWS access keys & secrets keys, merge conflict unresolved files
- `.bashrc` - shell tuning and sourcing of `.bash.d/*.sh`
- `.bash.d/*.sh` - thousands of lines of advanced bashrc code, aliases, functions and environment variables for:
  - [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) & [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
  - SCM - [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), [Svn](https://subversion.apache.org)
  - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
  - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  - [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)
  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
  - automatic GPG and SSH agent handling for handling encrypted private keys without re-entering passwords, and lazy evaluation to only prompt key load the first time SSH is called
  - and lots more - see [.bash.d/README](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools/blob/master/.bash.d/README.md) for a more detailed list
  - run `make bash` to link `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile` and the `.*` dot config files to your `$HOME` directory to auto-inherit everything
- `lib/*.sh` - Bash utility libraries full of functions for
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
environment,
CI detection ([Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) etc),
port and HTTP url availability content checks etc.
Sourced from all my other [GitHub repos](https://github.com/harisekhon) to make setting up Dockerized tests easier.

- `curl_auth.sh` - wraps curl to send your username and password from environment variables or interactive prompt through a ram file descriptor to avoid using the `-u`/`--user` which might otherwise expose your credentials in the process list or OS audit log files. Used by other API querying scripts
- `k8s_api.sh` - finds Kubernetes API and runs your curl arguments against it, auto-getting authorization token and populating `Authorization: Bearer` header
- `ldapsearch.sh` - wraps ldapsearch inferring settings from environment, can use environment variables for overrides
